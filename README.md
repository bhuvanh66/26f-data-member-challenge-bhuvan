# Technical Challenge

## The challenge

Your challenge is to predict developer salaries from a real survey dataset
(about 5,000 responses), included here as `data/survey.csv`. Build a model that
predicts `annual_salary_usd`.

This survey is published as-is, so expect to spend time determining what data you actually have before starting.
Look at it column by column, decide what to do about what you find, and be ready to say why you did it that way.

There's no particular set of fixes/steps we're looking for. We just want to understand what you found, how you
went about it, and why.

**AI Usage Info**

AI tools are allowed and expected. You'll walk through your submission live in
your interview and we'll ask detailed questions about your specific choices, so
understand every line you submit, including anything AI wrote. A simple
approach you can fully explain beats an impressive one you can't.

## Optional additions 

Pick one if you want to go further:

- a more rigorous ML pipeline with proper validation and feature engineering,
- a frontend/dashboard to display the data and your predictions, or
- an additional API connection that enriches the dataset with outside data.

**Additions are a bonus, not a requirement. A clean base submission is a
complete submission.** We would much rather see a straightforward model you
understand completely than an ambitious one you're guessing about during the interview. 
Every minute spent on an addition is a minute not spent being able to explain your core work.
These additions should be built on an already solid core submission.

## Getting started

This is a template repository, please fork it to create your own repository and go:

```bash
git clone <your-new-repo-url>
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Submitting

**Commit and push to your assignment repo before your interview time**
Your last push before your interview is what we review. There's no separate
submission step.

Your repo should contain:

1. **Your code.** However you'd normally organize it — a notebook, a script, a
   small project. It doesn't need to be production-grade.
2. **Your predictions or your metrics** — enough that we can see how well it
   worked, in whatever form makes sense for what you built.

Commit as you go rather than in one push at the end. We don't grade commit
history, but it protects you from losing work.

## Practical notes

- **Language and tools are up to you.** Most people use Python with pandas and
  scikit-learn, and `requirements.txt` covers that.
- **There is no target score.** We are not ranking submissions by accuracy. A
  model with modest error and clear reasoning scores better than a strong one
  you can't account for. This is a genuinely hard prediction problem and the
  numbers are meant to look modest.
- **Don't over-engineer.** 2 to 3 hours is the intended scope. If you find
  yourself at hour six, stop and write up what you have.
- **Bring your submission to the interview**, on your own machine, ready to open
  and run. Have it up before we start.
- **Questions?** Ask Michael Maaseide (maaseide.m@northeastern.edu) or Samuel Baldwin (baldwin.sam@northeastern.edu). Asking a
  clarifying question is not a mark against you.

## How we'll evaluate it

We're interested in your reasoning far more than your results. During the
interview we'll ask about:

- **What you noticed in the data** and how you decided what to do about it.
  Where you made a judgement call, we'll ask why you made it that way.
- **Your modelling choices** — why that model, how you know it works, what you
  compared it against.
- **Your code** — we'll pick a few specific lines and ask what they do and why
  they're there. This applies equally to code you wrote and code an AI wrote for
  you.
- **What you'd do differently** with more time, and what you think the
  weaknesses are.

## The data

`data/survey.csv` — 5,000 responses, one row per respondent. These are
professional developers who answered the compensation question in the **Stack
Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2025**, published by Stack Exchange under the
[Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/).

## Running the app

Train the model (writes `ml/model.joblib`):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m ml.pipeline.train
```

Start the backend:

```bash
.venv/bin/uvicorn ml.backend.api:app --port 8000
```

Start the frontend (separate terminal):

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Restart the backend any time `ml/model.joblib` is
regenerated — it loads the model once at startup, not per request.
